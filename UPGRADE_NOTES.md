## How to Update an Existing Installation

1. Run the database upgrade script:
   ```
   python upgrade_db.py
   ```

2. Replace existing templates with updated versions from this upgrade package.

3. Update static assets (CSS/JS) with the new versions.

## Running the New Modular Version

The system has been restructured into a modular architecture for better maintainability and scalability. To run the new version:

1. Make sure all dependencies are installed:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the application using the new run script:
   ```
   python run.py --debug
   ```

3. The system supports both the old version (app.py) and new version (app_new.py) to ensure compatibility during transition.
